Getting started with Great Expectations
###############

Welcome to Great Expectations! This tutorial will help you set up your first local deployment of Great Expectations that contains a small Expectation Suite to validate some sample data. We'll also introduce important concepts, with links to detailed material you can dig into later.

The tutorial will walk you throw the following steps:

#. First, we will introduce you to the data and help you initialize a **Data Context**.
#. Then you will learn how to configure a **Datasource** to connect to your data.
#. You will then create your first **Expectation Suite** using the built-in **automated profiler**.
#. We will show you how to use this Expectation Suite to **validate** a new batch of data.
#. We'll also give you a tour of **Data Docs** to view your validation results.
#. Finally, in the optional section, you will learn how to **customize** your deployment.
