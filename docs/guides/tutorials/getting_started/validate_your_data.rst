Validate your data using a Checkpoint
============================

:ref:`validation` is the core operation of Great Expectations: “Validate data X against Expectation Y.”

In normal usage, the best way to validate data is with a :ref:`Checkpoint`. Checkpoints bundle :ref:`Batches` of data with corresponding :ref:`Expectation Suites` for validation.

Let’s set up our first Checkpoint! **Go back to your terminal** and shut down the Jupyter notebook, if you haven't yet. Then run the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

  great_expectations checkpoint new staging.chk taxi.demo

From there, you will be prompted by the CLI to configure the Checkpoint:

.. code-block:: bash

    Heads up! This feature is Experimental. It may change. Please give us your feedback!
    
    Which table would you like to use? (Choose one)
        1. yellow_tripdata_sample_2019_01 (table)
        2. yellow_tripdata_staging (table)
        Do not see the table in the list above? Just type the SQL query
    2

    A checkpoint named `staging.chk` was added to your project!
    ...

**What just happened?**

- ``staging.chk`` is the name of your new Checkpoint.
- The Checkpoint uses ``taxi.demo`` as its primary :ref:`Expectation Suite`.
- You configured the Checkpoint to validate the ``yellow_tripdata_staging`` table.

That way, **we can simply run the Checkpoint each time we have new data loaded** to ``yellow_tripdata_staging`` and validate that the data meets our Expectations!


How to validate data by running Checkpoints
----------------------

The final step in this tutorial is to use our Expectation Suite to alert us of the 0 values in the ``passenger_count`` column in the staging data! Run the Checkpoint we just created to trigger validation of the staging data:

.. code-block:: bash

    great_expectations checkpoint run staging.chk

This will output the following:

.. code-block:: bash

    Heads up! This feature is Experimental. It may change. Please give us your feedback!
    Validation Failed!

**What just happened?**

We ran the Checkpoint and it successfully failed! **Wait - what?** Yes, that's correct, and that's we wanted. We know that in this example, the staging data has data quality issues, which means we *expect* the validation to fail. Let's open up Data Docs again to see the details.

If you navigate to the Data Docs *Home* page and refresh, you will now see a *failed* validation run at the top of the page:

.. figure:: /images/validation_results_failed.png

If you click through to the validation results page, you will see that the validation of the staging data *failed* because the set of *Observed Values* in the ``passenger_count`` column contained the value 0.0! This violates our Expectation, which makes the validation fail.

.. figure:: /images/validation_results_failed_detail.png

.. admonition:: And this is it!

   We have successfully created an Expectation Suite based on historical data, and used it to detect an issue with our new data. **Congratulations! You have now completed the "Getting started with Great Expectations" tutorial**.

Wrap-up and next steps
----------------------

In this tutorial, we have covered the following basic capabilities of Great Expectations:

* Setting up a Data Context
* Connecting a Data Source
* Creating an Expectation Suite using a automated profiling
* Exploring validation results in Data Docs
* Validating a new batch of data with a Checkpoint

As a final, **optional step**, you can check out the next section on how to customize your deployment in order to configure options such as where to store Expectations, validation results, and Data Docs.
